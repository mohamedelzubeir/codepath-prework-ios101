An app I like to use is Apple's very own Books app. It is great for those who can't afford to buy or store books with them and accessible from the your phone. A feature I dislike about it is there is no orginzation by genre feature for Books you've purchased, I own lots of books there and have to dig through my collections everytime.

## Notes

   Not so much challenges but I had a bit of diffuclty locating the Adjust Editor Options button.
